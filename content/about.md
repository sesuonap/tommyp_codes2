hi there.  
my name is <b>thomas panouses</b>, most people call me <b>'tommy'</b> or <b>'tom'</b>  but you can call me anytime.  

i use code to solve problems and create cool things.

i went to school at flagler college, and graduated in 2017 with a bachelor of arts in business administration, with minors in economics and management information systems. toying around with code was fun, and something i had been doing off an on throughout college, which inspired me to take it more seriously as a career and attend a bootcamp after getting my degree. i completed the actualize bootcamp in chicago, il in july 2018.

Outside of code I'm interested in sports, videogames, beer, and binge watching shows just to name a few. 
When I'm not at the coffee shop typing away you can usually find me under a wave somewhere or on the hardwood getting buckets.   

i am currently seeking opportunities in web development, you can find my contact information [here](/contact).
