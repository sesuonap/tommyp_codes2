code is just a tool  
although i enjoy solving problems in a variety of domains, i specialize in <b>web development</b>.  

i have experience creating full-stack applications using <b>html/css/js</b> with <b>bootstrap</b> or a framework such as <b>vuejs</b> or <b>react</b> for the front end and <b>ruby</b> as my main backend tool. althought i have dabbled with wordpress and static site generators also.  

aside from the technologies listed above i am currently in the process of learning <b>python</b> and <b>go</b>(golang), as i find them to be interesting and promising technologies across a wide variety of domains, not limited to creating web apis. feel free to check out my [github](https://github.com/sesuonap) to take a look at any projects i've worked on.  

if you are interested, a more detailed list of technologies i've used is available on my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/tpanouses)
